- 👋 Hi, I’m Micah
- 👀 I’m interested in only the coolest things: Anime, Comic Books, Gaming, and Experiencing New Cultures.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Advanced Excel, and Python to become a Data Analyst.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating projects using subsets of Big Data and finding the most efficient ways a company can leverage that data increase revenue.
- 📫 How to reach me - is via email or my LinkedIn.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love TRAVELING! And I mean international traveling. So far my adventures have led me to Thailand, Japan, Philippines, The Bahamas, US and British Virgin Islands. I am just getting started and want to continue exploring!
